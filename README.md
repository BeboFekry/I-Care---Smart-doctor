## OverView
As a team leader i have distributed the tasks on the team members, i have decided to work with Agile methodology so i was making a meeting each one or two weeks with the team members to presenting the work done
i was responsible for the AI modules which are:

### My part in the project consists of three main modules:

Module 1: An AI based smart chatbot called "Caroline" talking to the patient 
and taking its disease symptoms by text or voice messages, then diagnosing the disease and 
recommend making some tests or medical imaging scans to do as x-ray, MRI, Complete Blood Count CBC, ... in addition, given 
information about the predicted disease as an overview, symptoms, and 
treatments.

It can predict 30 diseases such as (Breast Cancer, Influenza, Covid 19, Stroke, ...) 

Module 2: A sequence of AI Computer Vision models for scanning medical 
imaging scans and medical tests it can scan (X-ray, MRI, CT, OCT, CBC, or Food images), 
detect the image type (Image Recognition), if it is medical imaging image, 
applying anatomical recognition, disease evaluation, disease diagnosis, and also in tumor or bone fraction cases 
it can segmentate the tumor or the fraction using image segmentation.
         
It can predict 25 disease types such as (Bone Fracture, Brain Tumor, Covid 19, Breast Cancer, ...) 

It can read the Complete Blood Count (CBC) test images and evaluate overall health and diagnose conditions like anemia, infections, clotting disorders, and blood cancers by analyzing red and white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets.

It also can recognize 101 food types from images and shows the approximate number of calories per gram.

Module 3: An ensemble Machine Learning (Random Forest) Model for scan Electrocardiography ECG and diagnosis the heart diseases.

In addition of making algorithm for MBTI personality analysis test
