## OverView
As a team leader i have distributed the tasks on the team members, i have decided to work with Agile methodology so i was making a meeting each one or two weeks with the team members to presenting the work done
i was responsible for the AI modules which are:

### My part in the project consists of three main modules:

Module 1: An AI based smart chatbot called "Caroline" talking to the patient and taking its disease symptoms, then diagnosing the disease and recommend making some tests as x-ray, MRI ...
in addition, given information about the predicted disease as an overview, symptoms, and treatments.
It can predict 30 diseases such as (Breast Cancer, Influenza, Covid 19, Stroke, ...)

Module 2: A sequence of 14 AI Computer Vision models for scanning medical imaging and tests it can scan (X-ray, MRI, CT, OCT, ECG, or Food image), detect the image type (Image Recognition), if it is medical imaging image, applying anatomical recognition, disease evaluation, disease diagnosis.
It can predict 25 disease types such as (Bone Fracture, Brain Tumor, Covid 19, Breast Cancer, ...)
It also can recognize 101 food types from images and shows the approximate number of calories per gram.

Module 3: An ensemble Machine Learning (Random Forest) Model for scan Electrocardiography ECG and diagnosis the heart diseases.

In addition i have made some graphic designs as the Logo and the Banner,

Creating the Software Requirements Specification SRS and the proposal and give them to the other team members to working on them

Collecting the other' work and combining them, making documentation and the presentation

Making algorithm for MBTI personality analysis test
